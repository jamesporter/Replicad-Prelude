# Replicad-Prelude

Some basic helpers to use in [Replicad's workbench](https://studio.replicad.xyz/workbench)

Copy and paste [preluade.js](./prelude.js) into the code editor for some common stuff. Make things.

## Plan

- [x] RNG stuff
- [x] Vector Stuff (2D and 3D)
- [x] Poisson Disc
- [x] Basic helpers as suggested by replicad docs
- [x] Testing, including GHA

## Future/maybe

- [ ] (Perlin) Noise(?)
- [ ] Hexagon and triangular grid helpers

# Testing

Uses Bun (fast for testing)

```sh
bun test
```
