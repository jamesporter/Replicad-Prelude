# Replicad-Prelude

Some basic helpers to use in [Replicad's workbench](https://studio.replicad.xyz/workbench)

Copy and paste [preluade.js](./prelude.js) into the code editor for some common stuff.

## Plan

- [x] RNG stuff
- [ ] Vector Stuff (2D and 3D)
- [ ] Poisson Disc
- [ ] Hexagon and triangular grid helpers
- [ ] (Perlin) Noise(?)
